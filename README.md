## How To
I recommend installing Live Server from the VS-Code extensions, to view and edit the code.

## Maps

Let's start off with some basic web-map examples. There are different JavaScript Map-Libraries out there you can use. The most common ones I have added as an example to this repo. Each map includes a simple slippy map, with a base map, a marker and a popup for that marker.

- [Leaflet](https://leafletjs.com/reference.html)
- [Mapbox](https://docs.mapbox.com/mapbox-gl-js/)
- [MapLibre](https://maplibre.org/maplibre-gl-js-docs/api/)
- [OpenLayers](https://openlayers.org/en/latest/apidoc/)

You can get other basemaps from:

- [Mapbox](https://www.mapbox.com/)
- [OpenStreetMap](https://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Tile_servers)
- [Maptiler](https://openmaptiles.org/styles/)

Vector tile layer styles can also be created using the [Maputnik editor](https://github.com/maputnik/editor).
